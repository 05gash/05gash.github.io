<p>Youtube autoplayed Scheherazade by Rimsky-Korsakov the other day - I hadn’t listened to it all the way through before, but I’d heard the opening a few times. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQNymNaTr-Y&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=22m5s">This motif</a> (played by the clarinet) caught my attention though.</p>

<p>You hear it scattered throughout the <a href="https://youtu.be/oP_BQd0wivc?t=1h26m55s">Angry Aztec level</a> in Donkey Kong 64.</p>

<p>Pretty neat to tune in on the influences of composers. It’s also pretty neat if this happened by chance too.</p>
