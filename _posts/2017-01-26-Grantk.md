Youtube autoplayed Scheherazade by Rimsky-Korsakov the other day - I hadn't listened to it all the way through before, but I'd heard the opening a few times. [This motif](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQNymNaTr-Y&feature=youtu.be&t=22m5s) (played by the clarinet) caught my attention though.

You hear it scattered throughout the [Angry Aztec level](https://youtu.be/oP_BQd0wivc?t=1h26m55s) in Donkey Kong 64.

Pretty neat to tune in on the influences of composers. It's also pretty neat if this happened by chance too.
